# Civic Hackathon: Plowing Through the Data

The Civic Hackathon: Plowing Through the Data, Powered by AT&T is a partnership between the School of Information Studies (iSchool) at Syracuse University and the City of Syracuse to encourage community solutions to assist the City of Syracuse in addressing snow removal from the City's public roads.

The Hackathon is designed to engage technologists, designers, developers, and anyone else who is interested to use their skills for social good.

Every year, the City of Syracuse is covered with feet of snow and is often the snowiest place in the country.

With all of that snow, plows need to clear the more than 400 miles of roads to ensure safe transportation for the community. For the first time, the City of Syracuse has released data from GPS trackers on its snowplows in the hopes that students and volunteers can help find useful information from the thousands of rows of data generated.

For this hackathon, participants are challenged to create data visualizations, find interesting insights, and help City staff determine what they should look for from this data when it snows.

For example, you could: Create an interactive, and easy to use map of where snowplows have been and what they have been doing; build a searchable tool so a user could see if their street had been plowed; show where and how much plowing happens during specific time periods or in certain locations; or build a route optimization tool for plows.

Those are merely examples to provide an idea of possible projects, but participants are encouraged to think creatively and use the availabile data in any way they think helps the City realize its goal.

Participants may form teams, or may compete as individuals.
Cash prizes will be given for 1st ($3500), 2nd ($2000), and 3rd ($1500) place.
Anyone is eligible to participate - you do not have to be a Syracuse University student to take part.
Projects are due at 11:59 PM on March 1st - via the submission link at the bottom of this page.
Judging will take place after all entries are received, and winners will be notified by e-mail on Monday, March 5, and announced publicly at a ceremony on March 7.
Judges will evaluate projects along the following critetia: Presentation, Idea Creativity, Sustainability, Impact, and Technical Quality.
